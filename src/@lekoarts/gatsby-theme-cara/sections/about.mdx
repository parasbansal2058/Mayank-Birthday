## Closure

##### The English language can not fully capture the depth and complexity of our thoughts (Gaali dene mei feel nhi aati). So We're incorporating Emoji into our speech to better express ourselves. Winky face (with *Upshabad#*).

One million memories, ten thousand inside jokes, one hundred shared secrets, one reason: Friends. As we grow older we will make even more memories, jokes, and shared secrets. We can already imagine us becoming old buddies who take our morning walks together as we gossip about whatâ€™s going on in our lives. Your friendship is for keeps, and we intend to keep it forever. (Formality again)!!
